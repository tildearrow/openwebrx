    automatically, so a shared URL will include frequency and demodulator,
    which allows for improved sharing and linking.
  * New daylight scheduler for background decoding, allows profiles to be
    selected by local sunrise / sunset times
  * The owrx_connector is now the default way of communicating with sdr
    devices. The old sdr types have been replaced, all `_connector` suffixes on
    the type must be removed!
  * The sources have been refactored, making it a lot easier to add support for
    other devices
  * SDR device failure handling has been improved, including user feedback
  * New devices supported:
  * wsjt-x updated to 2.1.2
  * The rtl_tcp compatibility mode of the owrx_connector is now configurable
    using the `rtltcp_compat` flag
  * explicit device filter for soapy devices for multi-device setups
  * compatibility fixes for safari browsers (ios and mac)
  * Offset tuning using the `lfo_offset` has been reworked in a way that
    `center_freq` has to be set to the frequency you actually want to listen
    to. If you're using an `lfo_offset` already, you will probably need to
    change its sign.
  * `initial_squelch_level` can now be set on each profile.
  * Part of the frontend code has been reworked
    - Audio buffer minimums have been completely stripped. As a result, you
      should get better latency. Unfortunately, this also means there will be
      some skipping when audio starts.
    - Now also supports AudioWorklets (for those browser that have it).
    - Mousewheel controls for the receiver sliders
  * Error handling for failed SDR devices
  * One of the most-requested features is finally coming to OpenWebRX:
    Bookmarks (sometimes also referred to as labels).
    There's two kinds of bookmarks available:
    - Serverside bookmarks that are set up by the receiver administrator.
      Check the file `bookmarks.json` for examples!
    - Clientside bookmarks which every user can store for themselves. They are
      stored in the browser's localStorage.
  * Automatic reporting of spots to [pskreporter](https://pskreporter.info/) is
    now possible. Please have a look at the configuration on how to set it up.
  * Websocket communication has been overhauled in large parts. It should now
    be more reliable, and failing connections should now have no impact on
    other users.
  * Profile scheduling allows to set up band-hopping if you are running
    background services.
  * APRS now has the ability to show symbols on the map, if a corresponding
    symbol set has been installed. Check the config!
  * Debug logging has been disabled in a handful of modules, expect vastly
    reduced output on the shell.
  * New set of APRS-related features
    - Decode Packet transmissions using direwolf (1k2 only for now)
    - APRS packets are mostly decoded and shown both in a new panel and on the
      map
    - APRS is also available as a background service
    - direwolfs I-gate functionality can be enabled, which allows your receiver
      to work as a receive-only I-gate for the APRS network in the background
  * Demodulation for background services has been optimized to use less total
    bandwidth, saving CPU
  * More metrics have been added; they can be used together with collectd and
    its curl_json plugin for now, with some limitations.
  * New bandplan feature, the first thing visible is the "dial" indicator that
    brings you right to the dial frequency for digital modes
  * fixed some bugs in the websocket communication which broke the map
  * WSJT-X integration (FT8, FT4, WSPR, JT65, JT9 using wsjt-x demodulators)
  * New Map Feature that shows both decoded grid squares from FT8 and Locations
    decoded from YSF digital voice
  * New Feature report that will show what functionality is available
  * major rework on the openwebrx core
  * Support of multiple SDR devices simultaneously
  * Support for multiple profiles per SDR that allow the user to listen to
    different frequencies
  * Support for digital voice decoding
  * Feature detection that will disable functionality when dependencies are not
    available (if you're missing the digital
    buttons, this is probably why)
  * Support added for the following SDR sources:
    - LimeSDR (`"type": "lime_sdr"`)
    - PlutoSDR (`"type": "pluto_sdr"`)
    - RTL_SDR via Soapy (`"type": "rtl_sdr_soapy"`) on special request to allow
      use of the direct sampling mode
    - SoapyRemote (`"type": "soapy_remote"`)
    - FiFiSDR (`"type": "fifi_sdr"`)
    - airspyhf devices (Airspy HF+ / Discovery) (`"type": "airspyhf"`)
